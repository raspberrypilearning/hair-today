## Find an image

To begin, you will need to find two images: an image of a celebrity or person with the hairstyle you want to use in your project, and an image of the person you want to give the hairstyle to.

When you are looking for an image, you need to think about:

- How large the image is â€” images that are too small will not look good
- Whether you have **permission** to use the image

Permission to use an image could mean two different things:

1) If you have found an image online, it doesn't mean you necessarily have permission to use it. Photographs taken by other people are often published with a **license** that tells you how you are allowed to use the image. If you can't find a license, you shouldn't use the image.

2) If you are using your own photograph, think about whether the photograph is appropriate and whether the person in the photograph has given permission for it to be used. Using an image of a friend without permission might upset them. In addition, you should also follow [e-safety advice](https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/11_13/Need-advice/Posting-pictures-and-videos/){:target="_blank"} when posting pictures online.

If you [accidentally discover an image you find upsetting](https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/11_13/Need-advice/Things-you-see-online/){:target="_blank"}, close your browser immediately and tell an adult.

+ A good place to look for pictures online is [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}, where there are lots of images available under a Creative Commons license.
