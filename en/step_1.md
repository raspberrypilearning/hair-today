## Introduction

Write an online app to give people funny celebrity hairstyles with JavaScript!

This resource is based on an [original idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghH49nqPFo0&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"} by winning Pioneers team PiCymru for the **Make us laugh** challenge.

### What you will make

Use the sliders to move and shape the hair in order to position it on the person's head.
