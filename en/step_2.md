## What you will need

### Hardware

+ A computer capable of accessing the [trinket.io](https://trinket.io){:target="_blank"} website

### Software

This project can be completed in a web browser using the following sites:
+ [trinket.io](https://trinket.io){:target="_blank"}
+ [Pixlr image editor](https://pixlr.com/editor/){:target="_blank"}, which requires [Flash player](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html){:target="_blank"} to be enabled and unblocked

If you have other image editing software which supports layers and transparency (e.g. GIMP, Inkscape, or Adobe Photoshop), you can use that instead of Pixlr.

### Additional resources

+ Photographs of celebrities with hairstyles you like, or other appropriate images
