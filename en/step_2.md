## What you will need

### Hardware

+ A computer capable of accessing [trinket.io](https://trinket.io){:target="_blank"}

### Software

This project can be completed in a browser using the following websites:
+ [trinket.io](https://trinket.io){:target="_blank"}
+ [Pixlr image editor](https://pixlr.com/editor/){:target="_blank"} - requires [Flash player](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html){:target="_blank"} to be enabled and unblocked.

If you have other image editing software which supports layers and transparency (e.g. Adobe Photoshop) you can use that instead of Pixlr.
